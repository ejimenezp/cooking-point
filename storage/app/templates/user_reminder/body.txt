Dear CP_FIRSTNAME,

We have noticed you made an inquiry yesterday but the checkout process did not go through whatever the reason.

If you are still interested in the class you can recover your booking here (APP_URL/booking/CP_LOCATOR) to finish the registration.

If you are having problems with the payment and still want to attend the class, please reply to this email confirming your interest and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

Looking forward to meeting you,
cooking point team
