<p>Dear CP_FIRSTNAME,<br/></p>

<p>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to show you a bit of Spanish cooking tradition.</p>

<p>We'd be grateful if you share with the world your experience with Cooking Point. We'd love it if you review us on TripAdvisor, as this is the worldâ€™s largest travel site, and our guests often read past guests' reviews before booking their own class.</p>

<p>We remain at your disposal should you have any question or in case you need help when replicating our recipes back home.</p>

<p>Warm regards,<br/>
CP_COOK</p>
