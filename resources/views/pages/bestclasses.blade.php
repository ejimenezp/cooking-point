<div class="header2">100% Hands-on Classes</div>

<p>Our facilities are modern, confortable and luminous. We have several cooktops which are shared by two people each (don't worry if you come by yourself! We will try to find you a cooking mate). By following our instructors guidelines in English, you will perform all of the steps of each recipie. Everyone in the class performs the same tasks.</p>

<p>The maximum amount of customers per class is 12 but we are not usually fully booked. Of course, the classs includes enjoying the dishes that you will have prepared.</p>

<div class="header2">Suitable For Everyone</div>

<div class="header2">Open All Year-round</div>
<p>We are the school with more availability in Madrid. We offer 2 regular classes a day, 6 days a week, all year round.</p>

<div class="header2">Legal</div>
<p>We are a Company 100% Spanish, from Madrid, with all due licenses in force to teach cooking classes. In fact, we appear listed in the registry of activities recommended by the <a href="https://www.esmadrid.com/en/tourist-information/cooking-point">City of Madrid</a>'s official tourism website. We fulfill all of our legal obligations regarding health and safety, civil liability insurance and tax payment.</p>

<div class="header2">What We Are Not</div>
<p>We are not a franchise, there is only one Cooking Point and it is located in Madrid. We are not a restaurant or hotel teaching clandestine classes in a (most of the times) dark and unequiped kitchen. We are not impersonal resellers with fake photos and unefficient customer care.</p>

<div class="header2">Best Value for Money</div>
<p>Four hours of fun, no matter your choice.</p>
