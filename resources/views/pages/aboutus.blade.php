		<p class="header2">Eduardo</p>
		<p>Born and raised in Madrid, Eduardo decided to quit his engineering and marketing career to found Cooking Point in 2013 to teach the recipes he learned from his mum when he was a child. He believes gastronomy and the way people enjoy food say a lot about each country, feels like fish in water at the market or cooking something on the stove.

		<p>Also 100% Madridian, Laura has been combining her two passions —translation and cooking—, during her whole life. She loves unveiling the stories and legends behind each recipe and will take you through a historical and gastronomical journey in every class. When she is not teaching, you can find her at the market getting supplies for her recently discovered recipes.</p>
