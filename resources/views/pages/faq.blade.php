<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3>In-person Classes</h3>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>I have some dietary requirements, can I book?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Yes, we are ready to deal with most dietary requirements and allergies: vegetarian, no pork, gluten, dairy, seafood allergies... Anyway, don’t forget the cooking is done in pairs. You both need to agree on the alternative option. Also, when you book, please let us know your exact food restrictions.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>What is included in the price?</strong></dt>
	<dd>The price of cooking classes includes taxes, meals, ingredients, drinks, recipe booklet and market visit (if it's part of the class). You just need to be ready to have fun, the rest is up to us.</dd>
	</dl>

<dl>
<dt><strong>How do I pay?</strong></dt>
	<dd>To confirm the booking you will be requested to pay through our bank's payment platform (your card data never reaches our site).</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>What is the cancellation policy?</strong></dt>
	<dd>We refund 100% if you cancel up to 24 hours before the event.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>Can we bring children?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Knives, ovens and wine are not a child’s best friend. However, your children are welcome as long as they are accompanied by an adult and attended to throughout.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>I’m travelling alone, can I book?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Of course, but please note we will try and pair you with a cooking buddy. All recipes are written and prepared for two people. Besides, we need a minimum group of 2 people to hold the class.</dd>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>Where can I find my Online Class Handbook?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Go to your booking and email it again. You will receive the voucher with the handbook attached to it.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>What kind of pan is suitable for paella cooking?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Size matters here: we recommend a pan around 10" for 2 servings, and around 12" for 4. Besides, we advise against using cast iron, as these pans keep hot too long making hard to change their temperature.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>Can I book for just one person?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Yes, sure, but keep in mind it will be harder, as you have to do all the tasks.</dd>
